Parking-Slot-Detection-Using-Raspberry-PI-And-IOT-Techniques                                              


This project implements a parking slot detection system using Raspberry Pi and IoT technology, allowing users to monitor parking space availability via a mobile app.

Overview :              
The parking slot detection system utilizes Raspberry Pi along with IR sensors deployed in parking spaces to detect the occupancy status of each slot. The Raspberry Pi aggregates sensor data and communicates with a mobile app via Bluetooth to provide real-time parking availability information to users.

Features:                
1.Real-time parking space detection                 
2.Seamless integration with mobile app for user access                      
3.Efficient space utilization through dynamic parking guidance                           
4.Easy deployment and scalability
